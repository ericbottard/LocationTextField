LocationTextField is an add-on that geocodes addresses using a configurable geocoder.  Any class implementing
org.vaadin.addons.locationtextfield.LocationProvider can be used with LocationTextField.  There are currently two LocationProvider
implementations provided; one using Google's geocoder and the other using OpenStreetMap's Nominatim.  Adding new implementations is
trivial.  If the geocoder find multiple results for the address the results are available to choose from in a drop-down menu.

Note: It is the user's responsibility to make sure he or she abides by any rules or requirements for geocoder use.  For instance,
Google's geocoder will not even work unless it is used in a browser with GMaps in the DOM.  OpenStreetMap has a usage limit upon
which they will cut you off; however, MapQuest uses the OpenStreetMap code and has no limit.  MapQuest should be added next.
